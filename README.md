# Image-Classification-with-localization
- In this project i did Classification with localization (aka object localization)
- I used portion of Caltech-101 dataset this protion was ['airplanes', 'Faces', 'Motorbikes']
- functions that I used to parse data and show image all in my_helper_funcs.py file
- I trained two transfer learning models:
  - first one was with NasNet as base model
    - training class accuracy: 100%
    - training bounding box loss: 1551.15
    - Validation accuracy: 100%
    - training bounding box loss: 1293.05
  - second model was with VGG-16 as base model
    - training class accuracy: 0.9984%
    - training bounding box loss: 688.58
    - Validation accuracy: 100%
    - training bounding box loss: 802.32
